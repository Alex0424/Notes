# Lock-in

The practice of a provider to make it as hard as possible for its customers to change to another provider.

Example: Hotel California

"Relax", said the night man. "We are programmed to receive, you can check-out any time you like but you can never leave!"

# Payment models

Licenses
- per user (per "active" user?")
- per machine
- per CPU cores
- ...

Subscriptions
- 'pay as you go' (where are you going?)
- Free product BUT pay for support (i.e. RHEL, canonical)
Alternatively completely free
- your skills
- your time
- internet


# Lock-in - info

Current version is promised a long lifecycle with patches. Lo and behold, the promise is broken shortly after.

Certain versions/dependencies aren't supported anymore
- EOL(end of life) or moved to more expensive license tier

You don't control at which pace you update your applications

Key features disappear (usually behind a more expensive license tier)

Key features are re-designed into unusability

Legislation changes (GDPR, internal policies, ...)

Want to migrate to a competitor?
- It would be challenging

# Lock-In - The Nightmare

Backstory: you're responsible for the operation of an application. One day your application stops responding.

A closer look by a consultant reveals that the application is completely reliant on a provider's API/library/service which isn't available anymore. It needs to be completely re-written.

What do you do (except looking for a new job)?

that's why you always need to check EOL(end of life)
