# Datacenter

Datacenter - where the cloud lives

19" rack

historical inheritance from industry
- started by AT&T in 1922
- goal is to use space more efficiently

Industry standard for server hardware
- 1 unit height (44.5 mm)
- width 19"
- standard height on rack 42U

Densely packed racks
- rack space costs
- shorter distance == shorter cables needed
- mark everything (servers, bables, switches, name/tage on servers, security(cage lock on rack/server), cooling, ...)

Racks standardized measurements makes it easier to:
- uniform design (i.e: for temperature control)
- perforated metal for air flow
- easier handling of cables
- visual indicators

Redundancy
- power supplies (extra power supply)
- network (extra network cards)
- - redundant WAN access (different providers & min 2 cables)

# Challenges in the datacenter
Security & access
- physical security
- monitoring
- who comes in? (hackers, video-rec cameras in data center)
- logging (important)
- not only consider who comes in, but also with what, from a security point of view

### Space (how many racks fit)

rack space

electricity (redundancy: diesel generator(how much time does that buy us?)

temperature control
- servers give out a lot of warmth
- could be a positive (district heating)

Fire control
- systems to choke a fire without damaging the hardware (e.g. gas)

Blade server (next level density!)

uses rack space more effective

Thermal challenges

A common challange for datacenters is keeping the temperature down. High temperatures:
- shoren the lifespan of the hardware
- lead to worse performance (throttling)
